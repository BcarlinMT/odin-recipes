            <li>Salt and pepper</li>

            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen corn, thawed</li>
            <li>5 canned whole green chiles, seeded and coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>4 canned chipotle chiles, seeded and minced</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can stewed tomatoes</li>
            <li>.5 teaspoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>16 corn tortillas</li>
            <li>1.5 cups enchilada sauce, canned</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheddar and jack cheese</li>
            <li>Garnish: chopped cilantro leaves, chopped scallions, sour cream, chopped tomatoes</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Coat large saute pan with oil. Season chicken with salt and pepper. Brown chicken over medium heat, allow 7 minutes each side or until no longer pink. Sprinkle chicken with cumin, garlic powder and Mexican spices before turning. Remove chicken to a platter, allow to cool.</li>
            <li>Saute onion and garlic in chicken drippings until tender. Add corn and chiles. Stir well to combine. Add canned tomatoes, saute 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Pull chicken breasts apart by hand into shredded strips. Add shredded chicken to saute pan, combine with vegetables. Dust the mixture with flour to help set.</li>
            <li>Microwave tortillas on high for 30 seconds. This softens them and makes them more pliable. Coat the bottom of 2 (13 by 9-inch) pans with a ladle of enchilada sauce. Using a large shallow bowl, dip each tortilla in enchilada sauce to lightly coat. Spoon 1/4 cup chicken mixture in each tortilla. Fold over filling, place 8 enchiladas in each pan with seam side down. Top with remaining enchilada sauce and cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 minutes in a preheated 350 degree F oven until cheese melts. Garnish with cilantro, scallion, sour cream and chopped tomatoes before serving. Serve with Spanish rice and beans.</li>
        </ol>
